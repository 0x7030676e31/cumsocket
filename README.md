# Cumsocket v2
Cumsocket is a "simple" Discord module based selfbot written in TypeScript that has features such as permissions management, Discord api, and more. Also worth mentioning is fact that selfbots are against Discord's ToS and can get you banned, this selfbot is not doing anything harmful to Discord's servers, but it's still against the ToS. I'm not recommending using selfbots but sometimes it's just fun to have one.


# Features
- Websocket handling
- Rich permissions management
- Discord API wrapper
- Module flexibility
- Database support
- Almost undetectable
- Rate limit handling
- Client like data handling (soon)

# TODO: Usage, Custom modules & Default modules


# Future plans
My goal was to create something like environment for module based selfbot. Over time maybe I will add more modules and features like client like data manager. I'll maintain this project as long as I can but discord likes to change api in a rather strange way. As long as I can, I'll try to keep this project up to date.
