# Cumsocket
Cumsocket is a "simple" Discord module based selfbot written in TypeScript that has features such as permissions management, Discord api, and more. It's currently in development and is not ready for deployment. Also worth mentioning is fact that selfbots are against Discord's ToS and can get you banned, this selfbot is not doing anything harmful to Discord's servers, but it's still against the ToS. I'm not recommending using selfbots but sometimes it's just fun to have one.

## Hosting
Bot is hosted on Heroku and uses Heroku Postgres database. Everything is updated automatically on push to master.

## Still TODO:
- Better logging system
- Add modules (math etc)
- Grow the api
- Clean up the code
- Presence management
- Client like events management system
- Create a better README.md
- And more!
