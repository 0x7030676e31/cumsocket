# Cumsocket
Cumsocket is a "simple" Discord module based selfbot written in TypeScript that has features such as permissions management, Discord api, and more.

## Still TODO:
- Add modules (math etc)
- Add postgresql support
- Grow the api
- Clean up the code
- Client like events management system
- Create a better README.md
- And more!
